                <b>Aphasia</b> is an acquired language disorder that impairs a person's ability to express and understand language. Some of the typical causes are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Stroke</li>
                    <li>Head injury</li>
                    <li>Brain tumor</li>
                    <li>Infection</li>
                    <li>Dementia</li>
                </ul>
            When caused by head injury or stroke, aphasia usually develops quickly. When caused by brain tumor, infection, or dementia, it develops more slowly. Aphasia generally only results when there's substantial damage to the left hemisphere of the brain (responsible for language function), either the cortex (outer layer) and/or the underlying white matter (responsible for learning and brain function).

        <div id="types"><h1 align="center">Types and Symptoms</h1>
            <p>There are 4 major types of aphasias and each has different characteristics and severity.
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#1">Wernicke's aphasia</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#2">Broca's aphasia</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#3">Global aphasia</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#4">Conduction aphasia</a></li>
                </ol>
            "Wernicke" is an area of the brain that handles comprehension and "Broca" is what handles expression.<br>

                <h3 id="1">Wernicke's aphasia</h3>
            <b>Wernicke's aphasia</b> is also referred to as <i>Receptive</i> or <i>Fluent</i> aphasia due to the impact on the ability to speak grammatically and use appropriate prosody. It's a more severe form of aphasia and is more common in older people. People with Wernicke's have difficulties understanding the meaning of spoken words and sentences and are usually unable to recognize their language disorder.<br>

            <!---broca--->
            <p>
                <h3 id="2">Broca's aphasia</h3>
            <b>Broca's aphasia</b>, also known as <i>Anomic</i> or <i>Expressive/Nonfluent</i> aphasia, is the mildest form of aphasia. People with Broca's are fluent and grammatically correct but have difficulty with retrieving words in speech and writing. Word retrieval failures lead to unusual pauses, talking around or substituting the intended word for a different word.<br>

            <!---global--->
            <p>
                <h3 id="3">Global aphasia</h3>
            <b>Global aphasia</b> is a severe form of aphasia that affects both expressive and receptive language skills, reading, and writing.
            <!---conduction--->
            <p>
                <h3 id="4">Conduction aphasia</h3>
            <b>Conduction aphasia</b> or <i>transcortical</i> aphasia is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, which is a white matter tract that connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. People with Conduction aphasia have good language comprehension and awareness of their errors, but have difficulty with speech repetition. They also have mild difficulty with word retrieval and speech production. It's a milder form of aphasia.

        <div id="treatment"><h1 align="center">Treatment</h1>
            <p>
                Although there's no one treatment proven to be effective for all types of aphasias, working with a multi-disciplinary treatment team, including doctors (often a physician is involved, but more likely a clinical neuropsychologist will head the treatment team), physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, dietician, and social worker can help the recovery.
                <p>Therapy for aphasia ranges from increasing functional communication to improving speech accuracy, depending on the person's severity, needs and support of family and friends. Therapy can take 2 or more years and most effective when begun quickly.
                <p>Improvement depends on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity as well as the patient's age, health, motivation, handedness, and educational level.
